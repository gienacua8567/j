            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>Physical activity is an important part of our health regimen. In today’s predominantly electronic and virtual way of life, it’s getting to be arguably more and more difficult to find opportunities to be physically active enough to maintain a healthy state. Nowadays, people are tied up to their smart electronic devices. They are so tied up that either they forgot or have drifted away from doing physical activity, and never realized it because they are always engaged to their devices. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Working people are more prone to this scenario. Imagine this -- you woke up to the sound of an alarm from your smartphone. You get up, take a shower, fix yourself, prepare your things at work, have breakfast. While having breakfast (sitting down) you probably read the paper for some news or you either get it from the TV or your other smart devices like the tablet or the laptop. Or if you are a “connected”  type of worker you probably would start working already; checking the schedule, email, and plan your day at work (all this time while sitting down). You get up again (make a few steps, yey!) to get to your car. You get in your car and drive away (sitting down) to work. Arrive at the workplace, park your car, head to the elevator then head to your office (taking another few steps, yey!). You get to your desk (sat down), turn your computer on and start working. After about 3 to 4 hours of work (sitting down all the while), you get up for lunch break.  You head to the pantry, the canteen, or out for lunch (making a more significant effort to gain some physical activity walking about before and after eating). A few minutes later, your back on your desk working again (sitting down, again) for the next 4 to 5 hours until the end of your workday.  Then you exert almost the same effort as coming to work, on your way home. Back at home, you have dinner (sitting down) then you retire for the day (lie down). Then repeat.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The point in all these is that majority of working people fall in this scenario almost every day. Is it tiring? You bet! You feel exhausted and dead tired at the end of every day. Despite that, you are still lacking the right amount of physical activity required to maintain your health. Looking back at the scenario, you probably noticed how much time you spend being sedentary (either sitting or lying down) more than being physically active (at least standing up or walking). This is not healthy. Not for you, nor for the company you work for.  Such a scenario would only promote stress, burnout, and other unhealthy condition for the worker. For the company, it will create a less productive workforce and will be a cause for poor employee retention. This will in turn cause the company to spend more directly on employee healthcare programs and on training new workers every time; rather than earning more revenue because of employee’s healthier wellbeing which makes them more productive and with high morale. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>To try to avoid this scenario, one of the best ways is for the company to adopt a good workplace health program promoting physical activities in the workplace. This need not be costly. Might only need some organization and allowable time to integrate some physical exercises during work hours. But in the absence of this initiative, there is still something you can do about this on your own. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>First of all, try to wear a comfortable pair of shoes to work in. If you can, try to inject as much physical activity while at work. Be conscious and take every opportunity to either stand and stretch your body every so often, just like giving your eyes a rest from looking and staring on the computer monitor all the time. If you hold such a position that you have your own secretary, do them a favor to walk to the pantry and make your own coffee. You’ll be doing a big favor to yourself as well. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>When you’re quite busy and just couldn’t get the opportunity to walk away from your computer, try to find a place or a way to be able to work while standing up. Speaking of which, did you know that some people think a lot better standing up? That means their productivity increases when allowed to stand or walk while working. There are even stand up tables available in the market or height-adjustable tables that you might want to consider. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>You can also bring small dumbbells or resistance bands that you can use to enhance your stretching exercises to make it more effective. You can do this while seated in front of your desk whether while working or on a short break. If there is not much room to move around, even a simple stretching while seated will do. Stretching helps you relax and relieve stress. If you feel like it… you could try to explore some seated yoga poses that either helps you relax or re-energize your body to last the day.
